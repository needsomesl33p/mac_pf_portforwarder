# Mac OS Packer Filter (pf ) port forwarder

This sh script sets up Packet Filter rules and redirects all outgoing TCP traffic on port 80 and 443 to the defined proxy server.  

You also need to have root permission to run the `pfctl` command.

## Usage

```
usage: ./turn_pf_on.sh [-ld] [file...]
	 -f <file> - loads the given pf.conf file from the specific location
	 -d (default) - it creates a pf_custom.conf file and loads it with the default forwarding rules
```

You also have to make the file executable:

`chmod u+x turn_pf_on.sh`

## Example:

`./turn_pf_on.sh -f /tmp/custom_pf_file.conf`

or

`./turn_pf_on.sh -d`

The default Packet filter rules are:

`rdr pass on $INTERFACE inet proto tcp to any port {80, 443} -> $PROXY_HOST port $PROXY_PORT`

Feel free to modify the PROXY parameters / variables as you need.
